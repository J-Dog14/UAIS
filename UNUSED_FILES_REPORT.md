### 🔴 DEFINITELY UNUSED (Safe to Delete)

#### Empty/Placeholder Files (100% Safe to Delete)
- `python/uais/scan_legacy_dbs.py` - **EMPTY FILE** (0 bytes)
- `python/uais/build_source_map.py` - **EMPTY FILE** (replaced by `python/scripts/rebuild_source_map.py`)
- `python/uais/attach_app_db.py` - **EMPTY FILE** (replaced by `python/scripts/match_athletes_with_app_db.py`)

- `python/scripts/compare_prisma_beekeeper_schema.py` - One-time comparison

#### Legacy Database Files (Old SQLite databases, likely migrated)
- `python/athleticScreen/Athletic_Screen_All_data_v2.db` - Old SQLite DB (data likely in warehouse)
- `python/athleticScreen/Athletic_Screen_UNIFIED_v2.db` - Old SQLite DB (data likely in warehouse)
- `python/armAction/aPlusKinematics.db` - Old SQLite DB (data likely in warehouse)
- `pitching_data.db` (root) - Old SQLite DB (data likely in warehouse)

#### Old R Migration Scripts (Likely already run)
- `R/athleticScreen/migrate_athletic_screen_to_postgres.R` - Migration script (already run)
- `R/proSupTest/migrate_pro_sup_to_postgres.R` - Migration script (already run)
- `R/readinessScreen/migrate_readiness_screen_to_postgres.R` - Migration script (already run)

### 🟡 LIKELY UNUSED (Review Before Deleting)

#### Old/Unused Modules
- ~~`python/common/athlete_creation.py`~~ - **USED** by `id_utils.py` - KEEP
- ~~`python/common/athlete_matcher.py`~~ - **USED** by ETL scripts - KEEP
- ~~`python/common/id_utils.py`~~ - **USED** by all ETL scripts - KEEP
- ~~`python/common/io_utils.py`~~ - **USED** by `process_raw.py` scripts - KEEP

#### Scripts That Might Be Manual-Use Only
- `python/scripts/consolidate_source_databases.py` - Might be used for one-time migration
- `python/scripts/generate_source_map.py` - **EMPTY FILE** - Safe to delete
- `python/scripts/check_athlete_by_name.py` - Diagnostic tool, might be useful to keep

- `python/scripts/init_warehouse_db.py` - One-time setup script
- `python/scripts/create_warehouse_database.py` - One-time setup script

#### Report Generation (Might be used manually)
- `python/athleticScreen/report_generation.py` - Placeholder file (see README)
- `python/athleticScreen/database_replication.py` - Might be used for replication
- `python/athleticScreen/create_report.py` - Check if used
- `python/athleticScreen/Create Report_College.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook, might be used manually

#### Curveball Test Utilities
- `python/curveballTest/updateReferenceData.py` - Utility script
- `python/curveballTest/testReferenceUpdate.py` - Test script
- `python/curveballTest/manualArchive.py` - Manual utility
- `python/curveballTest/clearReferenceData.py` - Utility script

#### Main Entry Points
- All `main.py` files in subdirectories
- All `process_raw.py` files

#### Configuration Files
- `config/db_connections.yaml` - **REQUIRED**
- `config/db_connections.example.yaml` - **KEEP AS TEMPLATE**
- `package.json` - **REQUIRED**
- `Makefile` - **USEFUL**

#### SQL Files
- All SQL files in `sql/` - **KEEP** (used for setup/migrations)
- Prisma migration files - **REQUIRED**

#### Documentation
- All `.md` files - **KEEP** (documentation is valuable)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Deletion (High Confidence)
1. Empty `python/uais/` directory files
2. `python/scripts/consolidate_duplicate_athletes.py` (replaced by `athlete_cleanup.py`)
3. All diagnostic/inspect scripts (one-time use)
4. Old SQLite database files (after verifying data is in warehouse)

### Review Before Deletion
1. Check if `athlete_creation.py`, `athlete_matcher.py`, `id_utils.py`, `io_utils.py`, `db_utils.py` are imported anywhere
2. Verify old database files are not needed as backups
3. Check if report generation scripts are used manually

### Keep
- All ETL scripts
- All core common modules
- All configuration files
- All documentation
- All SQL setup files

## Verification Steps

Before deleting, verify:
1. Search for imports of each file
2. Check git history to see when files were last modified
3. Verify database files are not needed as backups
4. Test that system still works after deletion
